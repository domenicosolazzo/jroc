11. 51pm BST 23: 51 And that’s the end of the road for today’s hole - by - hole report. It’s been a fascinating day, with Jimmy Walker the stand - out performer in the morning, Martin Kaymer and Henrik Stenson arguably even better in more testing afternoon conditions. But the pre - tournament favourite Dustin Johnson’s race is already run, while Rory Mc. Ilroy isn’t in much better nick if we’re being honest with ourselves. But in golf you never know. Tomorrow promises to be another cracker. Please join me here! -5: Walker - 4: Grillo, Fisher, Kaymer - 3: English, Hahn , Sullivan, Stenson - 2: Choi, Lingmerth, Fowler, Hend, Koepka, Streb, Taylor, Day, Vegas, Senden, Henley, Oosthuizen Updated at 11. 56pm BST 11. 44pm BST 23: 44 Stenson doesn’t give his long eagle putt quite enough welly. From 50 feet, he leaves it six short. A little tester if he wants the birdie. And in it goes, though he needs the whole hole. “Wow! ” he says, puffing out his cheeks as the left - hand lip does enough to snaffle his ball. That’s a three - under 67, another superlative round in a major. Willett gets up and down from the back to birdie as well; he escapes from a very average day with a one - over 71. But Dustin, who leaves his par effort three feet short, scribbles his name at the bottom of a seven - over 77. He’ll not be winning his second major this week. He might not be playing at the weekend, either, unless he does something very special tomorrow. 11. 38pm BST 23: 38 Ah, Dustin’s ball didn’t make it to the drink. This time. He’s got to lash hard, through thick rubbish, to send his ball to the back of the green. From where he was, the trouble he was in, that’s a very fine shot. But it’s far too little, too late. Before he tries to save his par from 25 feet, there’ll be a long eagle effort up the green by Henrik Stenson. 11. 36pm BST 23: 36 Dustin Johnson, the pre - tournament favourite, but now +6, tied for 140th in a field of 156, takes an iron off 18 for safety. And snap - hooks it into the drink. Upon taking his penalty drop, he pulls his third in the direction of the blue vagueness too! Little Jim from the Goons should be doing the commentary here. Has he got away with that ludicrous shot? It’s not clear. More anon. What we do know is, it’s Dustin Johnson Meltdown Time! Even if he hasn’t fallen in the water again, he’ll be pitching to the green from very thick rough. Meanwhile up on the dancefloor, Rose can’t get up and down from the bunker like Sergio. But it’s a par, and you can be sure he’d have gladly taken a 70 when he was walking off 10 at +2. 11. 24pm BST 23: 24 Stenson delicately tickles his birdie putt at 17 down the slope. Too delicate. He’s left himself a tricky five - footer for his par. He tidies up to stay at -2. Danny Willett can go to school on Stenson’s putt, but his effort kicks off to the left, and it’s a par. This year’s Master golfer looks miserable and frustrated, and remains at +2. Meanwhile Dustin Johnson, who blasted two mammoth hits down the long par - five only to find sand, can’t get up and down from the bunker. Another par, his sixth in a row, but so much damage was done earlier. He’s +6, and desperately needs a birdie down 18, plus a very good round tomorrow, if he’s to make the halfway cut. 11. 19pm BST 23: 19 Henrik Stenson is the only player left out there realistically likely to alter the upper echelons of the leaderboard tonight. He’s currently -2 and has wedged his third at the long, long 17th to 15 feet. A tricky downhill putt remains, but that’ll be a birdie chance. Up on 18, Justin Rose whistles his second into the Sands o’Sergio at the front of the green. An up and down from there, and he’ll be in red figures for the day. Whatever happens to the 2013 US Open winner, he’s fought bravely this afternoon to haul himself into the thick of it from the very average - looking position he was in a couple of hours ago. 11. 13pm BST 23: 13 Sergio splashes out to six feet, a wonderful effort from the front bunker with the pin near the back. A final - hole birdie, and he’s signing for a one - over 71. Bubba’s eagle putt is never reaching, but it serves as a good lag and he taps in for birdie. He’s carded 71 too. And finally Spieth takes two putts a la Bubba for his birdie, and despite having played very averagely all day, ends with a level - par 70. These lads are not out of it yet, especially if the weather holds tomorrow morning before turning in the afternoon. Meanwhile Russell Knox becomes the latest player to almost hole - in - one. His near miss at 9, rolling a couple of inches to the left of the hole, earns him a birdie. The US - based Scot signs for a level - par 70. 11. 03pm BST 23: 03 So having said that, Sergio plops his second into the bunker front left. In fairness, the wind is whirling around and could so easily have caught his ball, which didn’t land too far from a perfect position on the green. Spieth meanwhile finds the back of the green, where he’ll have a 20-foot go at eagle. Finally it’s Bubba who, coming out of the rough, has to chase his ball up a little, unable to rely on spin. He’ll have a putt for eagle too, albeit from another seven or eight feet outside Spieth. If these two putts go in, bog - average rounds will suddenly look a whole lot better. 10. 57pm BST 22: 57 Bubba, his dander up, smashes a 386-yard drive down 18. It’s so big, he runs out of fairway, the ball very nearly making its way into the creek. That’s absurd. His ball snags in the rough, so he’ll be OK, though he’ll lose a bit of spin control. Too good. Spieth follows him down with another massive one, though his stops a good 30 yards back on the downhill slope. Finally Sergio. Slightly spooked, he takes a 3-wood, and finds the fairway. You’d expect all three men to find the green from where they are, and have at the very least an optimistic look at eagle. 10. 52pm BST 22: 52 Up on 9, Kaymer dunks his tees shot into the sand on the right. He splashes out to six feet, and raps the putt home for another wonderful up and down. He signs for a 66, and at -4 is one off the lead set by Jimmy Walker. Henrik Stenson meanwhile sends his second over the flag at 15, then eases in a left - to - right curler for his birdie. He’s suddenly lurking ominously at -2, after a slow start and the worst of the conditions. Spieth and Sergio can’t make their birdie putts on 17, but Bubba was below the hole and could give his effort a good rattle. In it drops, and he rises to +3. 10. 48pm BST 22: 48 Martin Kaymer saves his par at 8 with a magnificent long bunker shot punched from 50 yards to five feet. What an up and down that is! He remains at -4, one off the lead. Justin Rose scrambles well from sand too, at 16, after dumping his tee shot in a bunker front left. He stays put at level par. Meanwhile on 17, Spieth, Sergio and Bubba all lay up - having found the rough, on this long hole even Bubba had no choice - then pepper the flag with their mid - irons. Each will have a good look at birdie. Updated at 10. 49pm BST 10. 40pm BST 22: 40 Is Jordan Spieth on the comeback trail? A fine tee shot at 16 swished to ten feet, and the birdie putt dispatched into the middle of the hole. He’s +1. Ah hold on, he’s just pulled his drive at the mammoth 17th - 636 yards! - into the rough stuff down the left. Bubba, at +3, hollers “DAMN! ” loud and true after sending his tee shot into the rough down the other side. And finally Sergio, at +2, follows Bubba into the deep. Elsewhere, another birdie for Justin Rose, this time at 15, and he’s back to level par all of a sudden. Meanwhile on 9, Steve Stricker, fresh off a fine Open Championship, bumps a chip in from the fringe to sign for a 69. And he’s joined there by the 2002 winner Rich Beem, who gets up and down from a tight spot, shortsided, on the right of the green, for his par. The veterans embrace warmly, and well they should at -1. 10. 28pm BST 22: 28 Another bogey for Sergio, this time at 15. He’s +2 now, bereft of momentum, and surely a third top - five finish in a major is beyond him already. He needs a strong finish on the two par fives, put it that way. Justin Rose had been pootling along at +2, but rolled one in from the fringe at the back of 14. “I’ve just googled Arby’s and can already feel a coronary coming on,” reports Andy Gordon. “But the thought of a Masters champion’s dinner of Beef with a side of Hamburger Helper is tempting. ” Mmm. Does Helper count as one of your five a day? Let’s say yes. 10. 21pm BST 22: 21 One of the biggest cheers of the day as - you know who - rattles in a 15-footer on 18 for a birdie and a level - par 70. Yep, it’s him. Beeeeeeeeeeef. He waves his putter around in the air like a conductor as the gallery trills its love. He’s hovered just over the par line all day, and has his reward right at the end. Also hanging on in there: Jordan Spieth, who duffs a putt from the fringe at the back of 15, leaving himself a 12-footer for his par. But in goes the saver, and he’s +2. An odd round for the 2015 Masters and US Open champion: a double bogey at 7, and every other hole a par. 10. 11pm BST 22: 11 John Senden signs for a two - under 68. After dropping that stroke at 5, the Aussie veteran shed another at 7, but he’s finished off nicely by curling in a 15-footer on his final hole, the 9th. Meanwhile Martin Kaymer isn’t a million miles away from draining a monster across 6 for another birdie, but he settles for his par. He’s -4, one shot off Jimmy Walker’s lead. -5: Walker (F) -4: Grillo (F) , Fisher (F) , Kaymer (15*) -3: English (F) , Hahn (F) , Sullivan (F) 10. 05pm BST 22: 05 The new Open champion Henrik Stenson swishes a magnificent tee shot to four feet at 12. He guides in a very gentle double - breaker, and the birdie takes him to -1. Meanwhile Beef - now sponsored by Arby’s, David Puddy’s favourite restaurant - makes a garden - variety par at 17. He’s then required to high - five just about every punter between green and tee. He’s half exhausted by the time he makes it to 18! He giggles uncontrollably at the absurdity of it all. 9. 57pm BST 21: 57 Young - han Song today. News of how Young - han Song made it to -2: creaming a delightful tee shot at 12 straight at the pin, the ball gently rolling up to a couple of inches. We’ve been close to a few holes in one today. A little catch - up with Sergio’s progress: he bogeyed 12, and is currently +1 through 13. He’s there alongside two former PGA champs in Jason ‘Somnambulist’ Dufner and weight - lifting Tiger - hunter YE Yang. Updated at 10. 12pm BST 9. 51pm BST 21: 51 Martin Kaymer doesn’t connect properly with a chip from the fringe at 5, and leaves himself a 20-footer for par. But he calmly rolls it straight into the cup. A brilliant scramble to keep hold of a share of second place at -4. The conditions are certainly tougher this afternoon; other than Kaymer, only Russell Henley, Daniel Summerhays and Young - han Song (all -2) are bothering the top 20 positions. 9. 48pm BST 21: 48 It’s Dustin Johnson Meltdown Time! He drives into sand at 11, then whips a pitching wedge into the face of the bunker. His second attempt stops a good 40 yards short of the green. So much for him bottoming out. His fourth shot bites 12 feet behind the flag; he’s got that left for bogey. It’s pushed way to the right, never going close. Awful. A double. He’s +6. Meanwhile his playing partner Danny Willett had started steadily with five pars then a birdie, only to drop strokes at 7 and 9. Now another stroke is lost as he lets an eight - footer slip by. He’s +2. Henrik Stenson is holding the major - winning side up: he’s level par right now. Updated at 9. 48pm BST 9. 36pm BST 21: 36 Beef continues to entertain. Down the left of 15, he hits his second straight left over some trees and behind a scoreboard. Opting not to take line - of - sight relief, he flops over the scoreboard and lands his ball six feet from the flag. Astounding. Then he misses the par saver. He taps in to drop to +1, gives the crowd the peace sign, then tilts his head back and screams AW MAN! The gallery can’t get enough of him; the collective sympathetic “Oh! ” when he missed the putt was louder than the celebration of some birdies. Star quality. You either have it, or you don’t. They’re eating out of his hand. Andrew “Beef” Johnston watches his tee shot on the 15th. Photograph: Mike Groll/AP Updated at 10. 05pm BST 9. 32pm BST 21: 32 Bubba isn’t far away from a hole in one, either. He’s a couple of feet away at 12. Then he pushes the short par effort left. What a waste. He waves his hands around in the expressive style. After birdie at 2 and bogeys at 4, 5, 9 and 10, he remains at +3, going nowhere fast. Dustin appears to have bottomed out, though. Having birdied 9, he’s an inch away from splashing in from sand at 10. He stays at +4, but there’s an energy surrounding him once more. That could go either way, of course, but my word he needed something. 9. 26pm BST 21: 26 Louis Oosthuizen made hole in one at the Masters. He made hole in one at the Open. And he was three inches away from making hole in one here. A smooth, two - bounce 7-iron at 9. A beauty. He loves his big moments at the majors, doesn’t he? Holing out from the fairway at last year’s US Open, and of course that albatross at the Masters in 2013. Such a shame that didn’t drop. Ah well, he’ll tap in for a birdie that brings him back to level par. He’s a player who surely deserves more than one major to his name. Could this be the week he finally adds to that 2010 Open procession? 9. 17pm BST 21: 17 Dustin Johnson has been struggling awfully. But he fires his tee shot at 9 straight at the flag, then rolls in the straight 15-footer for his first birdie of the day. That’s some response to all those dropped shots, and it gives him a glimmer of hope as he turns for home: he’s +4. However his playing partner, the Open champ Henrik Stenson, misses a par tiddler from 18 inches. Wow. He’s back to level par. Meanwhile a bounce - back birdie for Martin Kaymer at 3; he moves back to -4. 9. 13pm BST 21: 13 Is the Beef even more popular Stateside than he is back in his homeland? It’s very possible. Huge cries of “Beeeeeeeeeeeef! ! ! ” as he tickles in a 25-foot birdie effort on 14. Four birdies and two bogeys in his last six holes. He’s nothing if not entertaining. But also, as Paul Mc. Ginley points out on Sky, incredibly resilient. His easy - going, emotionally generous, heartwarming demeanour may be at the root of his popularity - he’s walking around with a massive grin on, again, a man enjoying his life playing golf - but his street - fighting smarts will tick a few boxes too. He’s an immensely entertaining player, and incredibly likeable to boot. 9. 06pm BST 21: 06 Anyway, for those of you who are just getting home from work, as they say on television . here’s our main man Ewan Murray on the travails of Rory Mc. Ilroy . . and the mojo - rediscovering Rickie Fowler. Updated at 9. 07pm BST 9. 04pm BST 21: 04 The wind is picking up, and causing Sergio a fair bit of confusion. He’s a club short coming into 10. But he chips up to four feet and scrambles a momentum - saving par. He stays at level. Par for Spieth, too, the young American very unfortunate when his approach took a hard bounce on the green and left him a little too much to do with his birdie putt. He’s still +2 and in desperate need of a birdie to light a flame. 9. 01pm BST 21: 01 Kaymer’s second takes a huge flyer out of rough down the left of 2. At the bottom of the bank at the back, he lobs up delicately to six feet, an astonishing result from where he was. A chance to save his par. But he doesn’t take it. He slips to -3. Senden finds bother off the tee at 5. That’s a dropped shot and he’s back to -2. But birdies at 17 and 18 for young Thomas Pieters of Belgium; he’s -2. The 24 year old made his major - championship debut at the Open a fortnight ago, and finished in the top 30. He’s highly rated, clearly the real deal. 8. 55pm BST 20: 55 Dustin Johnson continues to unravel. He’s not melting down in the trademark style that makes us love him so; it’s just that loose shots are slipping through his fingers with metronomic regularity right now. All very mundane. A six - footer pushed past the hole at 7, and that’s three bogeys on the bounce. He’s crashed down the leader board to +5. Meanwhile a short putt pulled on the par - three 9th, and that’s another bogey for Justin Rose. He reaches the turn at +2. 8. 48pm BST 20: 48 Spieth dumps his tee shot at 9 into a bunker to the right of the green. He does well to get up and down in two for his par; he’s out in two - over 36. As is Bubba, who drops another shot after pulling a five - foot putt wide. Sergio meanwhile pars to reach the turn in level - par 34. “The US PGA is probably my favourite major of the year, coming as it does after the Masters and both Opens,” begins an emotional Simon Mc. Mahon. “It’s like a free bar at a wedding. Whatever happens, everything’s a bonus. And the fact that I was blubbing three times in 15 minutes watching Ian Poulter and Olly at Medinah in Sky’s fabulous Sporting Triumphs this morning has given me renewed hope that miracles can, and do, happen. Hope in the face of difficulty; hope in the face of uncertainty; the audacity of hope! ” Are you at a wedding now? 8. 44pm BST 20: 44 The 2010 champ Martin Kaymer is on a charge! His second at Baltusrol’s opening hole is sent pin high to 20 feet, and he rolls a reasonably straight effort across the green and into the cup. That’s his third birdie in a row, his fourth in five holes, and an excuse for a look at the leaderboard! -5: Walker (F) -4: Grillo (F) , Fisher (F) , Kaymer (10*) -3: English (F) , Hahn (F) , Sullivan (F) , Senden (13*) 8. 39pm BST 20: 39 Justin Rose started quickly with birdie at 2, but he’s since hit a sticky patch. Bogey at 4, and now a 15-footer for another bogey at 7, after underhitting a 7-iron. But he slides that one in, a gentle swinger from right to left, and wanders off the green with a huge smile on his face. He’s slipping back to +1, but that could have been worse, and he knows it. A bogey that won’t hurt too much: they don’t come around too often. Updated at 8. 26am BST 8. 37pm BST 20: 37 Jordan Spieth really isn’t enjoying himself right now. Having found all sorts of trouble down the right of 7, he now lashes his drive at 8 into a bunker on the left. He spins round and waves his big stick around in anger, showcasing a fine left - handed swing that Bob Charles would have been proud of. Sergio meanwhile takes an iron off the tee for safety, finds the thick rough on the right, then leaves his second shot 30 yards short of the green. What a plan. Spieth responds with a fine sand shot to 12 feet. He’s left with a straight uphill putt, but the ball bobbles the minute he hits it, robbing the effort of pace. A birdie chance spurned, and he remains at +2. And we’re back to Sergio, who chips up to eight feet but can’t scramble his par. He’s level again. A disappointed Jordan Spieth on the 7th. Photograph: Scott Halleran/PGA of America via Getty Images Updated at 9. 47pm BST 8. 28pm BST 20: 28 On 6, Dustin finds more trouble, this time down the left, and his second takes a flyer through the green. He’ll have a tricky up and down from the bottom of a tousled bank. He gets close enough with a very delicate chip, but lets the four - foot par putt slide by the left. He’s +4, and this is a Mc. Ilroyesque start to his round. But it’s better news for his partners. A long rake across the green for Danny Willett, and there’s a birdie that might kick - start his round. He’s -1. Stenson meanwhile sashays straight up the middle of the hole with two near - perfect shots, then slides a 15-foot double - breaker into the cup. Birdie, and he’s back to -1 again. 8. 24pm BST 20: 24 2010 champion Martin Kaymer today Martin Kaymer splits the 18th fairway, then whistles a lovely long iron straight at the flag. The ball races past the hole but turns round on the slope at the back of the green. What a fine shot that was by the two - time major winner. He’s got an eight - footer left for his eagle. The left - to - right breaker is never going in, but he taps in for birdie, and he’s -3. Spieth meanwhile leaves his long par putt on 7 a good 12 feet short. He pulls the one he’s faced with, and that’s a double bogey. He’s +2, and not looking particularly happy with life at this exact moment. Updated at 10. 05pm BST 8. 16pm BST 20: 16 Jordan Spieth hasn’t been finding many fairways of late, but this is ridiculous. He’s sliced his drive into thick oomska down the right. His ball nestles under a bush. He’s got a shot out, but it’s only a little punch. This is a long, long par four, so the young two - time major winner is in all sorts of trouble now. He lashes a fine third onto the front of the green, but that’s a long two putts for bogey. Meanwhile back on 5, Dustin is out of position from the get - go and leaves himself with a 20-footer for par. The pre - tournament favourite is +3 already. Stenson meanwhile has a good look at birdie from six feet, but doesn’t hit the putt and remains at level par. 8. 09pm BST 20: 09 A very solid start by the 2010 champion Martin Kaymer. He was going along nicely and quietly, level par through the first five holes. Then birdies at 15 and now 17, and suddenly he’s -2. Also out and about on that mark, Russell Henley, who has played the back nine in 34 strokes, and the 2002 winner Rich Beem: the jovial Sky commentator has been putting in some long hours to prepare for this year’s tournament, and it’s paying dividends. After opening with birdies at 10 and 11, he bogeyed 15, but has picked up another shot at 18 to reach his turn in 34. 8. 05pm BST 20: 05 Mirim Lee today This isn’t the only major golf tournament going on right now. The Women’s British Open started today at Woburn, where Mirim Lee of South Korea shot a course - record 62. That’s a full 12 strokes better than the world number one, the New Zealand teenage sensation Lydia Ko. Brittany Lang, who recently broke her major duck by winning the US Open amid scenes even more farcical than the men’s - the USGA really have excelled themselves this year - shot 72. England’s Charley Hull loses her sunglasses at the Women’s British Open in Woburn, Milton Keynes. Photograph: Kieran Galvin/REX/Shutterstock Updated at 8. 37pm BST 7. 50pm BST 19: 50 Not a lot of movement at the top of the leaderboard. Many of the afternoon starters are struggling to come to terms with greens hardening and speeding up under the baking sun. Of the second batch of players, John Senden is, like a pint of plain, your only man. -5: Walker (F) -4: Grillo (F) , Fisher (F) -3: English (F) , Hahn (F) , Sullivan (F) , Senden (10*) 7. 46pm BST 19: 46 Justin Rose can’t get up and down from the bunker to the back right of 4, and he’s level again. Senden visits a couple of bunkers on his way down 1, but manages to scramble par; he stays at -3. Sergio meanwhile is out of position down the left of 5, but whips his wedge off a generously flat lie to six feet. But he doesn’t commit to his birdie putt, and what a chance spurned. He stays at -1. His playing partner Bubba drops back to +1, though, after finding sand and splashing out rather lamely. 7. 43pm BST 19: 43 Quite a bit of trouble for Dustin down the long par - four 3rd, as he hoicks his 3-wood into trees down the right. He’s forced to chip back out and doesn’t get particularly close with his wedge in. He underhits his par putt from the back, leaving himself a tricky five - footer for bogey. And he shoves it wide right. Double bogey. He’s +2. Stenson meanwhile mishits a long birdie putt from the front, a very strange effort that’s left 20 feet short of the hole! You don’t see that kind of mistake too often in professional golf. From the sublime to the Sunday hacker. He’s back to level par. Willett makes his third quiet par in a row. 7. 27pm BST 19: 27 Another birdie for John Senden, this time at 18. He wedges from the rough down the right to eight feet, using the bank at the back of the green to bring his ball in, and strokes home the putt. He’s -3. Jordan Spieth has opened with four pars, though having found the centre of the par - three 4th with a glorious 7-iron, was unlucky to see his 20-footer bodyswerve the hole on the left just at the very last turn. Sergio makes par from the fringe at the back of the green, but Bubba, from a similar distance, chips heavy and can’t make the five - footer he leaves himself coming back. 7. 22pm BST 19: 22 By contrast, Dustin Johnson and Danny Willett leave themselves monster birdie efforts. Dustin very nearly curls in a 50-footer from the back of the green, but par will do. Willett leaves his well short but curls in a five - footer with what Butch Harmon on Sky describes as a “one - cup break”. That was a lot harder than it looked. Meanwhile at the par - three 12th, Joost Luiten fires his tee shot straight at the flag. A couple of bounces, and it’s rolling towards the pin. Right at the pin. It hits the stick flush, and really should drop in for a hole - in - one, but somehow it clanks off to the right. That’s a tap - in that’ll take him to -1, so not to be sniffed at, but still. 7. 15pm BST 19: 15 Henrik Stenson didn’t make a birdie at 1. What’s going on? What on earth is he up to? But normal service is resumed at 2! He eases his wedge to six inches. That’s effortless brilliance from the new Open champion. He’s an infamously streaky player, so coming off the back of that birdie - rattling nonsense at Troon, the early signs are looking good for the big Swede. Henrik Stenson plays his shot from the first tee. Photograph: Andy Lyons/Getty Images Updated at 7. 22pm BST 7. 10pm BST 19: 10 The traditional major - winning group is out: Masters champion Danny Willett, US Open hero Dustin Johnson, and Open birdie - making - madman Henrik Stenson. Birdie chances for them all at 1, but not one drops. Jhonattan Vegas pulls a short par putt on 18, and a fine 67 becomes a slightly miserable 68. Still, he’d have taken that at the start off the day. Sergio birdied 2 as well, albeit in a much calmer style than Bubba. And coming behind him, Justin Rose knocks his second to three feet, then teases in a birdie putt with a hell of a lot of right - to - left break for such a short distance. These greens are tricky to read all right. 7. 02pm BST 19: 02 One of the most preposterous birdies you’ll ever see. Yes, it’s Bubba! He wangs a wild drive into the trees down the right of 2, fashions a Seve - style chip under overhanging branches and down a steep grassy bank to find the centre of the green, then drains a 20-footer that stopped to think about staying up, but toppled in eventually. Similar fun and games involving John Senden on 16. The Aussie left a birdie putt dangling over the edge of the hole. He took an ostentatious walk around the edge of the green, and just before he motioned to tap in, the ball dropped. Birdie! On Sky, Paul Mc. Ginley points out that the ten - second rule only applies when you arrive at the ball, so while Senden was being a saucy bugger by circumventing the green, he wasn’t circumventing the rules and there’s nothing wrong with that at all. Marvellously clever! He’s -2. Updated at 7. 04pm BST 6. 53pm BST 18: 53 Andy Sullivan announced himself last year with three wins on the European Tour, plus a decent top - 30 showing in the Open at St Andrews. He’s since turned it up a notch in the big events, finishing tied for 23rd this year at Oakmont, and just outside the top ten at Troon. The 30-year - old from Nuneaton is a late - blooming talent, and his career curve could continue to bend pleasantly upwards this week. Level par through his first 14 holes today, he birdied 6, 7 and 9 to sign for a three - under 67. One ahead, on what is suddenly a decent day for English golf, is Ross Fisher, who having birdied the par - five 17th, picked up another stroke on the only other par - five, the 18th. That’s a wonderful 66. (And I’ve just remembered about Harris at -3, but honestly, no pun was intended when I started typing. ) -5: Walker (F) -4: Grillo (F) , Fisher (F) -3: English (F) , Hahn (F) , Sullivan (F) , Vegas (16*) 6. 40pm BST 18: 40 Sergio dumps his second at 1 into greenside sand. He splashes out to four feet, though, and saves his par with a tense putt. Great scrambling. Bubba creams his approach pin high to ten feet, but can’t make his birdie. Spieth meanwhile, after a fine second from sand, does a Rory (formerly known as a Monty) by leaving his birdie putt from similar distance well short. Pars all round.

Rory Mc. Ilroy giggles nervously as he pars and signs for a dismal 74. And Phil Mickelson two - putts for par and a 71 that qualifies as a fine rescue act. Speaking of bodyswerving trouble . it’s Beef! Andrew Johnston, the cult hero of the Troon Open, hasn’t started well, with bogeys at 1 and 3. He looks to be heading for another at the par - three 4th, as his tee shot lands short of the green and hops straight left towards the drink. But his ball lands on the stones lining the water, and rebounds back to the right. Safe and dry! The flag’s taken out, in the hope of a ludicrous chip - in for birdie, but he settles for par in the end. The crowd, needless to say, go bananas. Bananas and Beef! A delicious broth of a player. 6. 32pm BST 18: 32 On the 1st tee, a group of the highest quality: Sergio Garcia, Jordan Spieth and Bubba Watson. This could be an awful lot of fun. Or very depressing. But that’s golf for you. Sergio opens by blootering a 300-yard drive down the left of the fairway. It trundles into the first cut, but that’s not too bad. Then the brilliant young Spieth, who could do with a good week to make a few critics pipe down. But he’s driven into sand down the left. Finally Bubba, who hits an absurd high draw that sails towards the trees on the right and nearly ends up in sand along the left. If he’s in the mood to play some Bubbagolf today, on a course that favours long hitters, the next few hours could be wonderful. 6. 24pm BST 18: 24 Lee Westwood has signed for a one - under 69. It was a strange, lop - sided round. Starting at 10, he was two over through five holes, then birdied 17 and eagled 18, before making like Nick Faldo and coming back with nine straight pars. He’s got some good company in the clubhouse at the -1 mark: Hideki Matsuyama, Chris Wood, Victor Dubuisson, Justin Thomas, Paul Casey and Jamie Donaldson. Meanwhile Ross Fisher moves to -3 after sliding in a left - to - right 15-footer for birdie on the long, long, long par - five 17th. Lee Westwood looks at his scorecard on the 15th.

At 8, he knocks a 25-footer up to six inches, but that’s a par. He’s -2, but it could have been so much better. Pars there too for Mc. Ilroy (+4) and Mickelson (+1) . Jhonattan Vegas has birdied 6; added to the ones at 16 and 18, he’s -3 and in a tie for third. Adam Scott signs for a level - par 70. And it’s a super - fast start for the 2002 surprise champion Rich Beem: birdies at 10 and 11, and the easy - going veteran would no doubt be happy if the tournament ended now. He’s now -2. Updated at 11. 26pm BST 6. 08pm BST 18: 08 A quick look at the leaderboard, with most of the morning starters back in the clubhouse now: -5: Walker (F) -4: Grillo (F) -3: English (F) , Hahn (F) -2: Choi (F) , Lingmerth (F) , Fowler (F) , Hend (F) , Koepka (F) , Streb (17) , Day (16*) , Sullivan (16*) , Fisher (16) , Vegas (14*) Rory Mc. Ilroy plays an approach shot on the 18th. Photograph: Stuart Franklin/Getty Images Updated at 6. 39pm BST 6. 01pm BST 18: 01 Thanks Ben. And what a time to come back, as Phil Mickelson drains a 15-footer across the 7th green. That’s two birdies in a row, and his third in five holes. He’s hauled himself right back into this championship, at +1 with two holes still to play, despite not playing very well at all. Rory Mc. Ilroy, meanwhile, leaves yet another putt short. Par, which leaves him stranded at +4. His putting has been beyond a joke today, he’s never got a feel for the pace of these greens at all. Updated at 11. 49pm BST 5. 44pm BST 17: 44 Jimmy Walker has completed his round for the day -5. It’s worth noting that current the American’s best PGA Championship finish came two years ago at T7. That’s also his best ever result a major. “He’s swinging really good. He didn’t need a lot of work,” said Butch Harmon yesterday, who has been working with Walker. Today he’s on 65 and leading. And, just like that, Scott Murray is back with you ladies and gentleman for the remainder of the coverage. Updated at 11. 25pm BST 5. 39pm BST 17: 39 Phil Mickelson’s putter is gathering some real pace now. He hits another lengthy birdie putt to bring him back to +2. That’s Mickelson’s second birdie of the day, after a bogey on the second. Mc. Ilroy is still four over par. Updated at 11. 26pm BST .
